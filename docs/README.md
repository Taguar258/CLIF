Introduction

Hey there, this is the wiki of CLIF a framework created for python with which you can create interactive command-line interfaces.
I mainly created this because, while creating interactive interfaces you can easily get lost in your code.
Therefore the reason you should be using it is probably that it's created to make your code easily readable.
CLIF ends the work of creating endless if statements and let you just create a clean looking interface for your end-users.
You don't even need to download any requirement just downloaded the template and create your first interface.
This tutorial will be a step to step guide and at the end of it, you will be able to create beautiful interactive command-line interfaces.

PS: You should know advanced python.
