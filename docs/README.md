Introduction
--------------------
Hey there, this is the officail tutorial for CLIF a framework created for python with which you can create interactive command-line interfaces.
I mainly created this because you can easily get lost in your code while creating interactive command-line interfaces.
Therefore the main reason for using it is probably that it's created to make your code easily readable.
CLIF ends the work of creating endless if statements and let you just create a clean looking interface for your end-users.
You don't even need to download any requirement, just downloaded the template and create your first interface.
This tutorial will be a step to step guide and at the end of it, you will be able to create beautiful interactive command-line interfaces.

PS: You should know advanced python.
