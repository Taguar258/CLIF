**CLIF is a python framework to create interactive command-line interfaces.**

The aim of CLIF is to make code more human readable.

CLIF can be optimized the way you want to make your idea work.

## What makes it different?
- [x] **Automated** and **helpful** for **advanced usage**.
- [x] **Effective** and **powerful** in shuting down hosts and servers.
- [x] Root/su/sudo **only** needed for stronger POD, but not required.
- [x] **Testing** and **performing stronger attacks** is the goal of Raven-Storm.
- [x] Raven-Storm supports a **ddos mode** to connect and make every attack stronger.
- [X] Over **48 commands** and **more than 2200 lines of code**, for **optimizing your usage**.
- [X] Features 2 different layer attacks (Layer 3 + 4). (Soon: 3 (Layer 7))
